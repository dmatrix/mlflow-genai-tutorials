    "Traditional experimenting tracking or logging isn't enough for LLM applications:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Traditional logging - hard to debug\n",
    "print(\"Calling LLM...\")\n",

    "print(f\"Response: {response}\")\n",
    "# What happened inside? How long did it take? What was sent or received?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Distributed Tracing\n",

    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trace**: A complete execution of an operation\n",
    "- Represents one request or workflow\n",
    "- Contains one or more spans\n",
    "- Has a root span\n",
    "\n",
    "**Span**: A single operation within a trace\n",
    "- Has a start and end time\n",
    "- Contains inputs and outputs\n",
    "- Has metadata (model, tokens,latecy, etc.)\n",
    "- Can have parent-child relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "**Span Attributes**: Additional metadata\n",
    "- Model name\n",
    "- Token counts\n",
    "- Temperature\n",
    "- Custom attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Span Types\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow defines standard span types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CHAIN`: A sequence of operations\n",
    "- `LLM`: Language model call\n",
    "- `RETRIEVER`: Document retrieval\n",
    "- `EMBEDDING`: Text embedding\n",
    "- `TOOL`: Tool/function execution\n",
    "- `AGENT`: Agent reasoning\n",
    "- `PARSER`: Output parsing or generic intermediate parsing of an outcome \n",

      "\n",
      "Response: Tracing — capturing structured, correlated records of requests, prompts, model responses, intermediate steps, system events and metrics — is extremely valuable in generative-AI systems. Key benefits:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Faster debugging and root-cause analysis  \n",
      "  - Correlated traces let you follow a single request from client through prompts, tool calls, model outputs and downstream services, making it far quicker to identify where failures, errors or unexpected outputs occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reproducibility and auditability  \n",
      "  - Storing prompts, model version, temperature, system messages, tool call logs and runtime context lets you reproduce a particular response later for investigation, audits, or regulatory purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Safety and risk detection (hallucinations, bias, policy violations)  \n",
      "  - Traces let you detect patterns of harmful behavior or hallucinations, link them to trigger prompts or model versions, and create mitigation rules or filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Performance monitoring and SLO management  \n",
      "  - Trace data provides latency, error rates, and throughput per model, prompt size, or downstream tool, enabling capacity planning and alerting on SLO breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Cost optimization  \n",
      "  - By correlating tokens consumed, model type, and latency with business outcomes, you can choose cheaper models, caching, or prompt techniques where appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Prompt engineering and product improvement  \n",
      "  - Analyzing which prompts, system messages, or examples lead to desired outputs helps tune prompts, design better templates, and improve UX.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Model evaluation, A/B testing and drift detection  \n",
      "  - Traces let you compare behavior across model versions or experiments, measure regressions, and detect model drift over time from the same input distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explainability and compliance reporting  \n",
      "  - For regulated domains, trace records provide an evidentiary chain showing why a particular output was produced and which policies or safeguards were applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Better telemetry for complex, compositional flows  \n",
      "  - For apps that call external tools, chains of reasoning, or multiple models, tracing lets you see every step in the chain and how they affect final outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Improved incident response and automated mitigation  \n",
      "  - Real-time trace-based alerts can trigger automated rollbacks, throttling, or routing to safer models when risky patterns are detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tracing items to capture (minimum useful set)\n",
      "- Unique request/session IDs to correlate events  \n",
      "- Timestamped prompt/input, model version, model config (temperature, max tokens)  \n",
      "- Full model output plus confidence/metadata and any intermediate chain-of-thought or tool calls  \n",
      "- Latency and token counts (input/output) and error codes  \n",
      "- Client metadata, session/user id (privacy aware), region, and service/component spans\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy and compliance cautions\n",
      "- Avoid storing PII unless required and authorized; redact or tokenize sensitive fields  \n",
      "- Use sampling, aggregation, and retention policies to limit exposure and cost  \n",
      "- Encrypt traces and apply least privilege access controls; document retention for audits\n",
